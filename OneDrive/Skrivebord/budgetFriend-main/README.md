## Description of the project

The project is a tool to help private individuals or small businesses'. This means by getting an overview
of income and expenses to help the user to improve their economy. The application made in this project, **Budget
Friend**, is able to display an overview of their economy, help with economic related choices, 
budgets and accounting. 

The project is written with Java, CSS for styling and the **view** is generated by JavaFX.

### JavaFX concepts demonstrated in the project
The project does **not** make use of JavaFXML or SceneBuilder, but builds the GUI from within the Java code.
* General JavaFX structure: Stage, Scene, SceneGraph, Nodes etc.
* Event handling, using Lambda
* Buttons with unique functionalities
* File handling: import/export to a **.txt**-file with the budget-format, to keep persistent data in local files.  

### Challenges and further improvements
#### Changing scenes
The application had a few challenges when changing scenes. This included the window size went back to default when 
changing scenes. A solution was achieved by creating a method to store the size of the scene, before changing the window.

#### Saving recipes 
For further development and improvements, the application will include a method to keep persistent 
data from the **recipes gallery** in local file as well. By implement this function, the added recipes 
will not be lost when closing the application.
